This is a software for learning acetabular fracture classification (Judet and Letournel classification).  
It enables 3D visualization of each fracture pattern in Judet and Letournel classification and user-friendly interaction 
so that one could observe each fracture type from 360-degree viewpoint and comprehend it three-dimensionally.

It is based on VTK and Qt.
